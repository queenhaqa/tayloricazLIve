getting lost upstate\\nAutumn leaves falling down like pieces into place\\nAnd I can picture it after all these days\\n\\nAnd I know it's long gone and\\nThat magic's not here no more\\nAnd I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all\\nOh, oh, oh\\n\\n'Cause there we are again on that little town street\\nYou almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me\\nWind in my hair, I was there\\nI remember it all too well\\n\\nPhoto album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red\\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\\nAnd your mother's telling stories 'bout you on

prayer and we'd swear\\nTo remember it all too well, yeah\\n\\nWell, maybe we got lost in translation\\nMaybe I asked for too much\\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece\\n'Til you tore it all up\\nRunning scared, I was there\\nI remember it all too well\\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\\nSo casually cruel in the name of being honest\\nI'm a crumpled up piece of

it would have been fine\\nAnd that made me want to die\\nThe idea you had of me, who was she?\\nA never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you\\nNot weeping in a party bathroom\\nSome actress asking me what happened, you\\nThat's what happened, you\\nYou who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\\nSipping coffee like you're on a late-night show\\nBut then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come\\nAnd he said, \\\"It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one\\\"\\n\\nTime won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it\\nI'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it\\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first

remember it all\\nIt was rare, I was there\\nI remember it all too well\\n\\nAnd I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes\\n\\\"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age\\\"\\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\\nI'm a soldier who's returning half her weight\\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you,
