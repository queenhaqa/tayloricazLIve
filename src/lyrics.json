All there's left to do is run\nYou'll be the prince and I'll be the princess\nIt's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.\"\n\nSo, I sneak out to the garden to see you\nWe keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew\nSo, close your eyes\nEscape this town for a little while\nOh, oh\n\n'Cause you were Romeo. I was a scarlet letter\nAnd my daddy said, \"Stay away from Juliet.\"\nBut you were everything to me\nI was begging you, \"Please don't go!\"\nAnd I said\n\n\"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone\nI'll be waiting. All there's left to do is run\nYou'll be the prince and I'll be the princess\nIt's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'\n\nRomeo, save me. They're tryna tell me how to feel\nThis love is difficult but it's real\nDon't be afraid. We'll make it out of this mess\nIt's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.\"\n\nOh, oh, oh\n\nI got tired of waiting\nWondering if you were ever coming around\nMy faith in you was fading\nWhen I met you on the outskirts of town\nAnd I said\n\n\"Romeo, save me. I've been feeling so alone\nI keep waiting for you, but you never come\nIs this in my head? I don't know what to think.\"\nHe knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said\n\n\"Marry me, Juliet. You'll never have to be alone\nI love you, and that's all I really know\nI talked to your dad. Go pick out a white dress\nIt's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.\"\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\n\n'Cause we were both young when I first saw you"

Will it patch your broken wings?\nI'm only seventeen\nI don't know anything\nBut I know I miss you\nStanding in your cardigan\nKissing in my car again\nStopped at a streetlight, you know I miss you"

All there's left to do is run\nYou'll be the prince and I'll be the princess\nIt's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.\"\n\nSo, I sneak out to the garden to see you\nWe keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew\nSo, close your eyes\nEscape this town for a little while\nOh, oh\n\n'Cause you were Romeo. I was a scarlet letter\nAnd my daddy said, \"Stay away from Juliet.\"\nBut you were everything to me\nI was begging you, \"Please don't go!\"\nAnd I said\n\n\"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone\nI'll be waiting. All there's left to do is run\nYou'll be the prince and I'll be the princess\nIt's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'\n\nRomeo, save me. They're tryna tell me how to feel\nThis love is difficult but it's real\nDon't be afraid. We'll make it out of this mess\nIt's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.\"\n\nOh, oh, oh\n\nI got tired of waiting\nWondering if you were ever coming around\nMy faith in you was fading\nWhen I met you on the outskirts of town\nAnd I said\n\n\"Romeo, save me. I've been feeling so alone\nI keep waiting for you, but you never come\nIs this in my head? I don't know what to think.\"\nHe knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said\n\n\"Marry me, Juliet. You'll never have to be alone\nI love you, and that's all I really know\nI talked to your dad. Go pick out a white dress\nIt's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.\"\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\n\n'Cause we were both young when I first saw you"

I've been feeling so alone\nI keep waiting for you, but you never come\nIs this in my head? I don't know what to think.\"\nHe knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said\n\n\"Marry me, Juliet. You'll never have to be alone\nI love you, and that's all I really know\nI talked to your dad. Go pick out a white dress\nIt's a love story.

Don't know why I do\n\nDrew walks by me\nCan he tell that I can't breathe?\nAnd there he goes, so perfectly\nThe kind of flawless I wish I could be\n\nShe'd better hold him tight, give him all her love\nLook in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause\n\nHe's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar\nThe only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star\nHe's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do\n\nSo, I drive home alone\nAs I turn out the light\nI'll put his picture down\nAnd maybe get some sleep tonight\n\n'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar\nThe only one who's got enough of me to break my heart\nHe's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do\n\nHe's the time taken up, but there's never enough\nAnd he's all that I need to fall into\n\nDrew looks at me\nI fake a smile so he won't see"
